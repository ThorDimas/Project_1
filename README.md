Project Title: Meteorite Landings Over the World

Team Members: Paola Aleman, Paul Garay, Thor Dimas, Antonio Nava

Project Description:
We will be using an API dataset from NASA to geographically show different types of data. We will creat several matplots and geoviews to show where most meteorites have landed, where the biggest meteorites have fallen, the risk of each meteorite based on their mass, the year in which most meteorites landed on Earth. We can sort data based on country, size , type of meteorite, year. 

We were interested in this topic because we like science and we think that not many people have knowledge about meteorites and their risks. 


Research Question to Answer:
-Where have most meteorites landed?
-Where did the biggest meteorites land?
-Which year did the most meteorites land on Earth?
-Which is the most common type of meteorite?
-Which is the least common type?



Datasets to be used: https://data.nasa.gov/Space-Science/Meteorite-Landings/gh4g-9sfh  

Rough Breakdown of Tasks:
1. Clean up the data in a csv file
2. First we will develop to be run throught the csv file.
      Line chart: for Country vs Year
      Scatterplot: for the size of meteorites
      bar graph: for Country vs size
      pie chart: for types of meteorites and frequency of meteorite types
4. Then we will update it to be run through an API.
